Government and opposition parties have asked \nKing Norodom Sihanouk to host a summit meeting after a series of post-election \nnegotiations between the two opposition groups and Hun Sen's party \nto form a new government failed. Opposition leaders Prince Norodom \nRanariddh and Sam Rainsy, citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest opposition \nfigures after two alleged attempts on his life, said they could not \nnegotiate freely in Cambodia and called for talks at Sihanouk's residence \nin Beijing. Hun Sen, however, rejected that. ``I would like to make \nit clear that all meetings related to Cambodian affairs must be conducted \nin the Kingdom of Cambodia,'' Hun Sen told reporters after a Cabinet \nmeeting on Friday. ``No-one should internationalize Cambodian affairs. \nIt is detrimental to the sovereignty of Cambodia,'' he said. Hun Sen's \nCambodian People's Party won 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats in \nJuly's elections, short of the two-thirds majority needed to form \na government on its own. Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have charged that \nHun Sen's victory in the elections was achieved through widespread \nfraud. They have demanded a thorough investigation into their election \ncomplaints as a precondition for their cooperation in getting the \nnational assembly moving and a new government formed. \nKing Norodom Sihanouk has declined requests to chair a summit of Cambodia's \ntop political leaders, saying the meeting would not bring any progress \nin deadlocked negotiations to form a government. Cambodian leader \nHun Sen's ruling party and the two-party opposition had called on \nthe monarch to lead top-level talks, but disagreed on its location. \n``Papa will not preside over any summit meeting between the three \nparties, whether it is held in Phnom Penh or Beijing, because such \na meeting will certainly achieve no result,'' Sihanouk wrote in an \nOct. 17 letter to his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the \nsenior opposition FUNCINPEC party. A copy of the letter was obtained \nThursday. In it, the king called on the three parties to make compromises \nto end the stalemate: ``Papa would like to ask all three parties to \ntake responsibility before the nation and the people.'' Hun Sen used \nThursday's anniversary of a peace agreement ending the country's civil \nwar to pressure the opposition to form a coalition government with \nhis party. ``Only those who want to prolong the anarchy and instability \nprevent efforts to set up a new government,'' Hun Sen said in a televised \nspeech marking the anniversary of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords.\"\"\"\n# tokenize the text into sentences\nsentences = sent_tokenize(text)\n\n# remove stop words from each sentence\nstop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))\nfiltered_sentences = []\nfor sentence in sentences:\n    words = word_tokenize(sentence)\n    filtered_sentence = [word for word in words if word.lower() not in stop_words]\n    filtered_sentences.append(filtered_sentence)\n\n# calculate sentence scores based on word overlap with the input text\nsentence_scores = []\nfor sentence in filtered_sentences:\n    score = 0\n    for word in sentence:\n        if word.lower() in text.lower():\n            score += 1\n    sentence_scores.append(score)\n\n# generate the summary based on the top-scoring sentences\nmax_sentences = 3\nsummary_sentences = [sentences[i] for i in sorted(range(len(sentence_scores)), key=lambda i: sentence_scores[i], reverse=True)[:max_sentences]]\nreference_summary = ' '.join(summary_sentences)\n\n# print the reference summary\nprint(reference_summary)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-04T02:47:08.742597Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-04T02:47:08.743025Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-04T02:47:08.761466Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-05-04T02:47:08.742983Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-04T02:47:08.760072Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"``Papa will not preside over any summit meeting between the three \nparties, whether it is held in Phnom Penh or Beijing, because such \na meeting will certainly achieve no result,'' Sihanouk wrote in an \nOct. 17 letter to his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the \nsenior opposition FUNCINPEC party.
